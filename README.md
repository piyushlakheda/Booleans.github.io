Welcome to Varchasva, your number one source for all Government Schemes and services. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of organized experience, with a focus on spreading awareness of government schemes in public interest with one tap.

Founded in 2021, Varchasva has come a long way from its beginnings. It has first started out as a passion for creating and spreading awareness about all government schemes and services via a sole platform. Varchasva can offer you all the government services within one single tap. We hope to serve users all over India and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.

We hope you enjoy our initiative as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,
Team Varchasva
